# Online Judges - Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to the **Online Judges** repository! This repository contains solutions to a wide range of competitive programming problems from various online judges such as Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef, Light OJ, UVa, SPOJ, and Timus. Each problem has been solved in C++, with some accompanied by detailed explanations of the approach used.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by platform, and within each platform, problems are further categorized by topic or algorithm type.


- **Platform:** The online judge or platform where the problem was found (e.g., Codeforces, UVa).
- **Topic:** The type of problem or algorithm used to solve it (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory).
- **Problem Name:** A folder for each problem that includes the source code (`solution.cpp`) and sometimes an explanation (`explanation.md`).
